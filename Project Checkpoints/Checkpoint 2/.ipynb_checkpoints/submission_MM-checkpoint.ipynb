    "## Overview\n",
    "We are trying to predict hourly pricing for Lyft and Uber trips in New York City. Our approach involves looking to the Taxi and Limousine Commission of New York City data for trip information, weather data, and MTA subway trip data for alternative travel options. With multimodal transport options considered, we hope to be able to provide a model that can inform users to which mode of travel would be more efficient at a time."

There were several features that were dropped for having low variance or high emptiness. Trips where the components of the fare were less than the driver pay were dropped, these rows indicated that the driver was paid more than what the rider was charged which is not normally the case.\n",

    "* **Data Aggregation**: Data was aggregated to an hourly period from a trip level. Aggregations were calculated independently between apps and combined together at the end.

    "* **Description**: The MTA service alerts system is designed to inform passengers about events that can disrupt their travel, including both scheduled and unscheduled occurrences. These alerts cover a range of situations, from planned maintenance and construction to unexpected incidents like accidents or track issues. The alerts are created through continuous monitoring of the transit system, where potential disruptions are identified and communicated to passengers to provide timely and accurate information about how their travel may be affected.  \n",

    "#### Data Processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Collection**: Data was collected from 2020-04-28 to 2025-02-27. The raw file was downloaded as a CSV from NYC Open Data. It includes 5 years of service alerts for several transportation systems.\n",
    "* **Data Exploration**: Though the system provides some estimates on the expected delay duration for certain events in free text fields, this was not always provided. We ultimatley decided to assign a grade based on the level of severity we believed was appropriate for each. <br> There can be multiple service alerts per day or none at all. Here we see the counts per service alert across the year by month. <br> <img src='pictures/service_alerts_count_monthly.png' width =\"800\" height=\"300\"> <br>\n",
    "* **Data Filtering and Cleaning**: As this dataset contained multiple years worth of data, we limited it down to just the alerts from 2024. Most of the fields in this dataset were dropped as well, as we needed to aggregate the data to an hourly level due to the inconsistancy of the service alert timings. The service alerts were attributed to the start of the hour, so if an alert was published at 10:37 AM it would be attributed to the 10 o' clock hour.\n",
    "* **Missingness handeling**: The only feature in this dataset for this daterange was the Description field which was dropped in the cleaning process.\n",
    "* **Feature Engineering**: The Status Label feature gave some indication as to what type of service interupption the alert was. Some alerts combined several status labels in a pipe delimited list. Due to the inconsistant timing of the alerts, we aggregated to an hourly level for each transportation Agency.  For each Agency, we took the max severity level per hour. The severity levels to status label mapping is as follows:\n",

    "#### 2. **Linear Regression Modeling** \n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Observations & Data Review*\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling effort was based on four datasets with varying time granularities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Three datasets (Uber, Lyft, and Weather) were structured with hourly temporal resolution, enabling detailed trend analysis across daily cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Uber and Lyft datasets covered a consistent date range from 1/1/2024 to 12/31/2024 and included separate columns for date and hour, which required transformation to create a unified datetime field.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weather data spanned from 1/1/2020 to 12/31/2024 and included encoded numeric weather condition indicators, making it model-ready after filtering for 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The MTA Ridership data was available at a daily level, covering 3/1/2020 to 1/9/2025, and included system-level totals across Subways, Buses, LIRR, Metro-North, and more. This dataset needed downscaling and merging to match the hourly granularity of other inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable accurate modeling, preprocessing steps included datetime alignment, feature engineering (e.g., hour, weekday, month), merging weather conditions and MTA ridership data, and calculating aggregated ride cost metrics like total_rideshare_cost_mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Model Consideration*\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear regression model was selected due to its interpretability and its ability to quantify the effect of each independent feature on the target — hourly rideshare fare cost. This choice is especially useful for understanding how different variables, such as time, weather, and ridership, influence pricing patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Performance (on Train Set)\n",
    "- **MAE: 1.55** — Predictions are on average within $1.55 of actual prices, showing strong day-to-day accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MSE: 3.97** — Small squared error values indicate that large prediction mistakes are rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RMSE: 1.99** — Most errors fall within $2 or less, even for outliers, confirming stability across a range of inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R² Score: 0.8469** — The model explains approximately 85% of the variance in prices, demonstrating excellent predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics were reinforced by actual vs. predicted plots for both training and test sets, which show tightly aligned performance curves, minimal overfitting, and strong temporal tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Train Plot*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pictures/LR_Train Chart.png\" alt=\"Alt Text\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\">\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pictures/LR_test chart.png\" alt=\"Alt Text\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\">\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Feature Feedback & Interpretability*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Best Top Predictive Features**: tips_mean, precip, trip_miles_mean, snow, congestion_surcharge_mean, service_uber, and is_weekend_mode were the most influential.These captured trip characteristics, weather-related demand, traffic congestion costs, and differences between platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Moderate/Useful Features**:Time-based variables like month, weekday, and hour added useful seasonal and hourly trend insights. Environmental variables like uvindex, conditions, and feelslike showed minor influence alone, but may be useful when interacting with other features (e.g., feelslike × hour).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Low-Impact Features**: trip_count, windspeed, cloudcover, visibility, and daily MTA ridership metrics had negligible coefficients and could be dropped to simplify the model."
