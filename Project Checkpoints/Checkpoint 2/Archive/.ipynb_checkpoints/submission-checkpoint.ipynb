    "## Overview\n",
    "We are trying to predict hourly pricing for Lyft and Uber trips in New York City. Our approach involves looking to the Taxi and Limousine Commission of New York City data for trip information, weather data, and MTA subway trip data for alternative travel options. With multimodal transport options considered, we hope to be able to provide a model that can inform users to which mode of travel would be more efficient at a time. We believe mass transit options options can help with traffic and transit times for people in NYC."

    "Taxi and Limousine Commission of NYC data includes trip level data for the entire year. Data is available for Yellow Cabs, Green Cabs (more efficient), For Hire Vehicles, and High-Volume For Hire Vehicles. We focused on the High Volume data as this includes Lyft and Uber trips, as well as smaller rideshare platforms. Data is broken up by year, vehicle type, and month and is available as parquet files. The data is centered around taxi zones which will be explained later. [TLC data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) <p> Data Preprocessing:\n",
    "* **Data Collection**: Data was collected for the year of 2020 and 2024. The files are large (200MB+ each) so filtering and aggregation was applied.\n",
    "* **Data Filtering**: The High Volume data included several rideshare app platforms. This was filtered down to just Uber and Lyft, which made up the bulk of the data regardless. There were several features that were dropped for having low variance or high emptiness. Trips where the components of the trip cost were less than the driver pay were dropped, these rows indicated that the driver was paid more than what the rider was charged which is not normally the case.\n",
    "* **Data Aggregation**: The raw data for each year for just the two apps is over 200 million rows per year. This amount of data was too large to easily handle and was thus aggregated to hourly data split across apps. The categorical features such as pickup location and drop off location were aggregated to the most frequent of that hour. Numerical features such as trip distance were aggregated to the mean and sum of that hour.\n",
    "* **Taxi Zones**: The data is centered around taxi zones which are zones created by the TLC. Here is a map of the taxi zones in NYC:<br> <img src='pictures/nyc_taxi_zones_satellite_overlay.png' width = \"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data exploration questions were asked and examined. Some interesting findings include the following.\n",
    "* Connections: In the data, pickups are happening across a wide area of taxi zones, but the drop offs are more concentrated to specific zones or are headed out of NYC. Not shown in this image but in more granular exploration showed some taxi zones were serviced much more by one app over another. <br> <img src='pictures/nyc_rideshare_pickup_and_dropoffs_2024.png' width = \"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "* App Dominance: Uber is significantly more used in NYC than Lyft. It would be interesting to have access to the driver payout strucure between the two apps to see why. <br> <img src='pictures/nyc_rideshare_moving_avg_trip_volumes_2024.png' width = \"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "* Zone Connections: Where are people who are picked up in one zone getting dropped off? It turns out they don't typically leave their taxi zones. This is excluding airport pickups and dropoffs. <br> <img src='pictures/uber_lyft_connections_top_5_2024.png' width = \"500\" />\n",
    "\n",
