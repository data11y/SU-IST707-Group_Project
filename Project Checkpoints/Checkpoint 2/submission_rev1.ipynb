    "## Overview\n",
    "We are trying to predict hourly pricing for Lyft and Uber trips in New York City. Our approach involves looking to the Taxi and Limousine Commission of New York City data for trip information, weather data, and MTA subway trip data for alternative travel options. With multimodal transport options considered, we hope to be able to provide a model that can inform users to which mode of travel would be more efficient at a time."

    "* **Data Filtering and Cleaning**: The High Volume data included several rideshare app platforms. This was filtered down to just Uber and Lyft, which made up the bulk of the data regardless. There were several features that were dropped for having low variance or high emptiness. Trips where the components of the fare were less than the driver pay were dropped, these rows indicated that the driver was paid more than what the rider was charged which is not normally the case.\n",
    "* **Missingness Handling**: As the data was provided at a per trip level of granularity, it was aggregated per hour for the mean values of the numeric features or mode for the categorical features. This aggregation helped correct for any missing values.\n",
    "* **Data Aggregation**: Data was aggregated to an hourly period from a trip level. Aggregations were calculated independently between apps and combined together at the end.

Numerical features such as trip distance were aggregated to the mean and sum values of that hour.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Moderate/Useful Features**:Time-based variables like month, weekday, and hour added useful seasonal and hourly trend insights. Environmental variables like uvindex, conditions, and feelslike showed minor influence alone, but may be useful when interacting with other features (e.g., feelslike × hour).\n",

    "#### 3. **XGBoost Modeling with MTA Delays Integration**\n",

    "##### *Observations & Data Integration*\n",
    "\n",
    "This modeling phase explored how **NYC subway delays**, combined with rideshare trip characteristics and weather, impact hourly rideshare demand (`trip_count`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was built by merging:\n",
    "- Hourly rideshare data (Uber and Lyft)\n",
    "- Hourly weather observations\n",
    "- Daily MTA subway delay counts (aggregated and joined on date)\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing steps included:\n",
    "- One-hot encoding for categorical variables (`service`, `conditions`)\n",
    "- Type conversion for boolean fields\n",
    "- Aggregation of `total_delays` and temporal alignment across datasets\n",
    "- Final confirmation of a fully numeric, model-ready feature matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Model Consideration*\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected the **XGBoost Regressor** to model non-linear relationships and feature interactions across time, weather, trip, and delay dimensions. The model aimed to predict **hourly rideshare volume** using all available features.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Model Performance*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RMSE**: **1588.20**  \n",
    "  The model’s predictions are off by ~1,588 trips per hour on average, which is acceptable given the high range of trip counts observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Prediction Performance Plot*\n",
    "\n",
    "Shows the relationship between actual and predicted `trip_count`. The model tracks demand well, especially at mid-range volumes.\n",

    "The residuals are mostly centered around zero with a slight left skew, indicating generally good prediction performance without major bias.\n",

    "##### *Feature Feedback & Interpretability*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Top Predictive Features**:\n",
    "   - `service_uber`: Platform usage had the highest impact, likely reflecting Uber’s larger market share.\n",
    "   - `trip_miles_mean` and `trip_time_mean`: Longer trips strongly indicate higher hourly demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Moderate Contributors**:\n",
    "   - `is_weekend_mode`, `uvindex`, and `tips_mean` captured smaller but helpful signals.\n",
    "   - `total_delays` from MTA data added some predictive power, showing potential for behavioral response to subway outages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Low Impact Features**:\n",
    "   - Some weather categories (like `cloudcover`, `snow`, `conditions_#`) contributed minimally and may be useful only in interaction terms or under extreme conditions.\n"
