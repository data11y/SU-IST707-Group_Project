# Introduction 
 
## Objective 
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for NYC rideshare (Uber) prices using subway delays, ridership, and weather conditions. This will enable stakeholders to understand price fluctuations and make informed decisions. 
 
## New Approach 
Our approach integrates multiple datasets—including subway activity, weather data, and rideshare price fluctuations—to build predictive models using supervised learning techniques such as regression and classification. 
Model Options: Clustering, Regression, Classification (Supervised Learning) 
Significance: This model will estimate rideshare prices using external factors that are often overlooked, providing price forecasts and alternative transportation options for users. 
 
## Who Cares? 
Rideshare Companies: They can optimize surge pricing strategies based on external transportation conditions. 
NYC Residents: Users can plan rides better, avoiding high surge prices based on predicted conditions. 
Transportation Authorities: Insights into the correlation between subway delays and increased reliance on rideshare services. 
 
# Literature Review 
 
## Related Work 
Existing studies have integrated weather data with rideshare pricing, but few consider public transit as a key factor. 
Key References: 
Study on rideshare surge pricing and alternative transportation 
Research on congestion pricing and demand elasticity 
ML models predicting Uber/Lyft demand in urban settings 
Impact of weather on transportation choices 
 
## Stakeholder Needs 
Riders: Need accurate price predictions for better decision-making. 
Rideshare Platforms: Seek to optimize pricing based on transit alternatives. 
City Planners: Can use insights to improve transit reliability and pricing structures. 
 
## Feeback 
While integrating weather data with rideshare pricing is common, the impact of other transportation modes is often overlooked. We believe MTA subway delays significantly influence rideshare demand. Since surge pricing algorithms are proprietary, our approach aims to incorporate transit alternatives into predictive models, offering NYC residents insights into potential rideshare price fluctuations and alternative commuting options.

# Methods  
 
## Data collection 
Combining data from different formats and sources 

## Data Preprocessing 
Handle missing values via imputation  
Removing outliers. 
Potentially smoothing data with a moving average. 
Trend and seasonality handling 
Normalize numerical features 
Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding) 

## Feature Engineering 
Extract features like average delay impact on pricing 

## Model Selection 
Apply supervised learning models (Regression, Classification) 
Apply time series modeling such as ARIMAX 

## Evaluation 
Split dataset (80/20 train-test) 
Use cross-validation 
Evaluate with RMSE/MAE (for regression) and accuracy (for classification) 

## Interpretability 
Use visualizations to highlight key price influencers
